This is a scratch codebase for experimenting with QuantLib and OpenGamma with wiki notes not for production. Parts of opensource analytic libraries will be added and removed.

Re licences please see initial vendors and extract from thier codebase. This is not part of the Fin-Plus codebase and can be subject to code changes outside of the initial vendors with a high risk.

Currently looking at higher level wrappers to QLNet with concepts of markets and trade caches to replace Fin-Plus swig wrapper to QuantLibs main C++ code base for Fin-Plus POC framework demos re simple RT analytic wrapper.

Options

1) C++ QuantLib, C++ not best solution re rapid delivery.

2) OpenGamma, tightly couple to Bloomberg datasource.

3) Investingate QLNet as alternative for framework demo
apps re options 1) & 2). Incomplete under resourced library.
